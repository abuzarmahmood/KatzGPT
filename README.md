# KatzGPT

KatzGPT is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation augmented LLM trained on a corpus of scientific articles relevant to the Katz Lab.
It is intended to be used both as a summarizer and synthesizer of knowledge as well as an LLM-augmented article search.

Currently, KatzGPT is deployed as a Streamlit Chatbot App.

Below are a couple examples of KatzGPT in action.
